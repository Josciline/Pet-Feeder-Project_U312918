From the flowchart we can conclude that the actual outputs matched the expected outputs. The food was dispensed at the scheduled time only and not before or after time. The feeder machine checked the food bin to ensure that sufficient food was available. In case the food was not sufficient enough an alert was sent to the shelter staff to refill the bin. Food was dispensed to the pet at the correct time. The feeder machine determined if the food was eaten by the pet by comparing the weight of the tray at the time the food was dispensed and a little later. If the food tray weighed the same, it indicted that the pet had not eaten the food. The feeder machine monitored for 30 minutes to check if the pet ate the food and notified the staff in case the food was not eaten. If the pet ate the food, the feeder machine informed the staff that the pet had eaten the food.
